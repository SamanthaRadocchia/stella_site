* Beta Invite App

  This application allows for users to sign-up for the ShopwithStella beta
  using their email address. The models define 'Beta Users' who are inactive
  by default. Once they have been invited by Stella, they are active and awaiting
  confirmation of their sign-up. Once they have signed up, a new User is created 
  for them and their associated Beta User becomes obsolete.
